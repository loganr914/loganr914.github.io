        <h2 class="flashing-text">(Oct 13, 2025) SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION: developer realized shortly after starting to build this site that he forgot everything he knew about HTML and CSS. He hasn't written any since he went through a course that he didn't even complete last year, and he never learned any Javascript, then switched to making games with Python. He is now refreshing and expanding his knowledge in order to make this place less ugly. -developer</h2>

            Hey, my name is Logan! I'm a gamer, self-taught programmer and game developer from south Florida. I didn't like school much, but I love computers and had IT classes in both 8th and 9th grade that widened my eyes to the potential of what I can do with computers. Over the years since, I've been exploring every avenue in technology that has piqued my interest. A few months before the NVIDIA RTX 20 series GPUs were revealed, I discovered the world of custom gaming PCs.

            I did months worth of research until I felt like I had the perfect parts list on pcpartpicker.com, then the RTX 20 series reveal both blew my mind and dethroned the GTX 1060 I had as the GPU on my parts list.
