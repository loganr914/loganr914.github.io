# My Website
### (And how to make your own!)
As I was trying to align the image in the center while keeping the text aligned to the left, I realized how rusty I am with HTML and CSS since I haven't written any in about a year, which is when I started writing it for the first time, so the next commit will be much better once I refresh and expand my knowledge!

(I've never written any Javascript, but this website may change that)
